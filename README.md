This is the repository for the Spyder IDE website at [Spyder-IDE.org](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)
It is built using [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/), deployed via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), hosted on a custom domain.
The frontend is our very own [Lektor-Icon theme](https://spyder-ide.github.io/lektor-icon/), whose [documentation](https://github.com/spyder-ide/lektor-icon) should be consulted for details on what the various options do.

Content contributions and bug fixes/improvements are welcome!
For information on how to contribute to the site, including reporting issues, setting up a development environment and patching code, see the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/spyder-ide/website-spyder/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Workflow

The default branch is ``master``, which is continuously deployed with a GitHub Action to GitHub Pages at the domain [Spyder-IDE.org](https://spyder-ide.org/).



## Technologies and libraries used

This website is built using [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/), a static web generator that can be customized using [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) templates.


### Lektor plugins

The build also requires several [Lektor plugins](https://www.getlektor.com/docs/plugins/) (no extra configuration is needed; Lektor automatically installs them when building):

* [atom](https://github.com/lektor/lektor-atom)
* [disqus-comments](https://github.com/lektor/lektor-disqus-comments)
