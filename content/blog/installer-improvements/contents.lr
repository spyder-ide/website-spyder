[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) 5.4.0 was released recently and it came with some interesting features for its Windows and macOS standalone installers.
Starting with this release, Spyder will give more feedback to users when new versions are available and it will allow them  to download and update those versions in a graphical way!
In this post, we will be talking about these improvements and how the standalone applications update process is looking now.

But before proceeding, it is important to remark that this work was possible due to a [NumFOCUS Small Development Grant ](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/NumFOCUS-Small-Development-Grant-2022)awarded to Spyder, which has enabled us to hire a new developer  (Juan Sebastian Bautista Rojas) to be in charge of all the implementation details.

Before these improvements, Spyder already had a mechanism to detect more recent versions, but that functionality was very simple.
After informing users of the availability of a newer version, they had to follow a link to download the installer for it and then manually run it.
There was no other information regarding this process.

If you have the “Check for updates” option enabled, you have probably seen our previous dialog at some point!

Starting with our next version (5.4.1), to be released next December, users will be prompted by this message instead:

![Update available dialog from Spyder version 5.4.0 to 5.4.1 - New update available dialog](update-available-new.png)

As can be seen, Spyder will now be able to automatically download and install a new version on behalf of users, in a similar way that applications such as Firefox and Chrome handle their updates.

After clicking “Yes” on that dialog, Spyder will show the following one to inform users that the process has started and how much is left to finish it.

If the dialog is closed, the update will continue in the background.
Its progress will be displayed in a new status bar widget, so users can easily monitor it.

After the new version is fully downloaded, Spyder will ask users if they want to proceed with the update immediately or after it is closed, to avoid interrupting their current workflow.

If users agree to continue, our Windows installer will be started automatically, prompting users to close the current instance, uninstall the previous version and finally install the new one.

For macOS users, Spyder will automatically mount the new version’s DMG, so they can simply drag and drop its app to the Applications folder

Hopefully these improvements will make the experience of updating to Spyder 5.4.1, or any future version smoother, straightforward and pain free, in case you are using our standalone installers.
