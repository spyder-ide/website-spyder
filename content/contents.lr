Want to join the community of scientists, engineers and analysts all around the world using Spyder?
Click the button below to download the suggested installer for your platform.
We offer standalone installers on Windows and macOS, and as our Linux installer is are still experimental, we currently recommend the cross-platform Anaconda distribution for that operating system, which includes Spyder and many other useful packages for scientific Python.
You can also try out Spyder right in your web browser by [launching it on Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spyder-ide/binder-environments/spyder-stable?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fspyder-ide%252FSpyder-Workshop%26urlpath%3Ddesktop%252F%26branch%3Dmaster).

The built-in interpreter of the standalone version doesn't currently support installing packages beyond the common scientific libraries bundled with it, so most users will want to have an external Python environment to run their own code, like with any other IDE.
Also, the standalone installers don't yet work with third-party plugins, so users needing them should use Spyder through a Conda-based distribution instead.
For a detailed guide to this and the other different ways to obtain Spyder, refer to our full [installation instructions](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/installation.html), and check out our [release page](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/latest) for links to all our installers.
Happy Spydering!
